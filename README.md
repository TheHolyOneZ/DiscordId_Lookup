# DiscordId_Lookup
Just a Discord public information lookup for users u can also download their profile picture

## By the way if u press "window key + r" and type "%temp% there it will create a temp file with a "discord.exe" and the user infos thats why it gets detected by ur antivirus but it is save to use i promise u can just do "alt + a" and then right lcick and delete everything in ur temp folder
